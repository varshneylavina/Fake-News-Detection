Virat Kohli: Swiggy's 'Sorry Mango' Tweet For RCB Star After 6th IPL Century Burns The Internet,"© Provided by Times Now virat kohli: swiggy's 'sorry mango' tweet for rcb star after 6th ipl century burns the internet

Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) star batsman, Virat Kohli smashed his sixth IPL century against Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in just 63 balls to lead his team to their seventh win in the 16th edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL). For the Kohli fans, it was a moment of joy since it was his IPL century since 2019.

Following Virat's ton, the online grocery partner, 'Swiggy Instamart' shared a quirky tweet and soon after it was posted, it went viral and gained more than 1 million views on the social networking site. Swiggy Instamart wrote, ""Sorry mango.. cheeku is the real King.""

Even though the online delivery site hasn't taken any names but the cricket fans were smart to get the connection. On May 10th, RCB lost the 54th match of the IPL against Mumbai Indians by six wickets after which Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) bowler Naveen-ul-Haq shared a photo of him eating mangoes while watching the game and wrote 'Sweet Mangoes'. Meanwhile, Virat Kohli once in an interview said that Cheeku or Sapodilla is his favorite fruit. So, apparently, the Virat Kohli fans get the link to the tweet and have flooded with savage replies.

On May 1st, the Bangalore franchise faced LSG, and won the game by 18 runs. After the match, things got heated up as Afghanistan pacer and Virat Kohli had an on-field spat. LSG coach Gautam Gambhir was equally involved in the heated moment. The teams might once again square off later in the tournament.

RCB will square off against Gujarat Titan (GT) on Sunday (May 21) at 7:30 PM IST in their upcoming fixture of the IPL 2023. It will be a must-win match for the Faf du Plessis' side if they want to confirm their spot in the knockout stage of the tournament. After winning seven games out of 11 league matches, RCB are at fourth place on the IPL 2023 points table.

Optical illusion personality test: What you see first reveals people’s first impression of you,"There are many mind-boggling illusions over the internet but this one particular illusion has captured the attention of many.

This mind-bending visual can tell a lot about people's first impressions of you. The illusion features a pride of lions lounging by a tree in a wild nature scene. However, some viewers have spotted a hidden face within the image - a lioness formed by the branches of the tree. The image - posted to TikTok by user Mia Yilin - suggests that what people see in the image first could reveal a lot about their personality.

According to the image, there are two categories of people - those who saw the tree first, and those who saw the lioness first. If you saw the tree first, you may be someone who seeks solitude and prefers staying at home to socializing with others.

While you try to be happy, it can be hard for you to shake off negative feelings and move on quickly. If, on the other hand, you spotted the lioness first, you might feel awkward in social situations and dislike small talk, which could lead to feelings of being outcast or misunderstood.

At the Patna meeting, Opposition parties cast aside their individual agendas to put up a united front with an eye on defeating their common enemy — the BJP. Will the bonhomie last?

In normal circumstances, Parliament was the forum where one glimpsed signs of movement in the Opposition — or what remains of it. It manifested in a tentative regrouping of disparate forces to oppose a Bill introduced by the ruling party or heralded the start of a longer relationship but once a session wound up, nothing was seen or heard of such initiatives.

The swearing-in of HD Kumaraswamy as the Karnataka chief minister in May 2018 in a short-lived Congress-Janata Dal (Secular) or JD (S) government was a rare event that brought together leaders, from the trio of Sonia Gandhi, Mayawati and Mamata Banerjee, to N Chandrababu Naidu, Tejashwi Yadav and Arvind Kejriwal on a stage in Bengaluru, inspiring the Opposition’s hope that it might have spotted a rainbow coalition amid the dark clouds.",FAKE

The Ashes: Australia's greatness prevails but England can still fight on day five,"Last updated on .From the section Cricket

In sport, being the underdog is often described as a dangerous thing.

In some instances, it has been proved to be true - but more often than not, greatness will prevail.

England learned that lesson in the cruellest way late on day four at Trent Bridge, as Australia ripped through their top order with clinical brutality after the hosts had made such a positive start to their pursuit of 268.

With their backs to the wall after Tammy Beaumont and Emma Lamb's rapid 55-run opening stand, a feeling of hope - one so rare against Australia - started to drift through the crowd at Trent Bridge.

But with the hope came the tension, and with the tension came Australia's chance, and there is only so long you can keep greatness at bay.

England were cruising, but in consecutive overs, Beaumont and Lamb were gone - the former, a first-innings double-centurion, caught at slip, while the latter was pinned lbw by all-rounder Tahlia McGrath.

The floodlights beamed down on Trent Bridge, which became Australia's Colosseum, as England's hopes faded with the sun.

As pressure knocked on England's door, Australia blew it down with a double whammy, as star all-rounder Nat Sciver-Brunt and captain Heather Knight both fell to Ash Gardner's cunning off-spin.

Sophia Dunkley was undone by some surprising late-evening swing from Kim Garth, and Australia's job was half done.

But England have turned their fortunes around already in this Test match, and for the first time in recent years, it has been an even contest.

Gripping contest is still alive

Women's Ashes 2023: England take four wickets in under 30 minutes at Trent Bridge

Coach Jon Lewis' side have committed to their aggressive approach throughout the Test and, across four thrilling days so far, they have proved that it can work against the very best.

They have caused Australia to collapse, put their bowlers under pressure and in Beaumont's historic innings and Sophie Ecclestone's 10-wicket match haul, they have produced two of the finest performances ever seen in women's cricket.

It is quite simply to Australia's credit that they have refused to buckle under this pressure.

Six wickets down in the first innings, and Annabel Sutherland rescues them with a century from number eight.

With England approaching parity, they take four wickets for 15 runs to earn a 10-run lead.

And after a middle-order collapse of their own, captain Alyssa Healy stands tall with a counter-attacking fifty.

England race out of the blocks in their chase, and Gardner grinds them to a halt.

All the individual performances and all the twists and turns in momentum are already enough to make this Test a classic, without even considering that day five is approaching with all four results - we could even have a tie - still on the table.

'Wyatt must throw punches back at Australia'

Danni Wyatt, unbeaten on 20, has an opportunity to be England's hero - on Test debut, no less.

She was picked for this reason.

An aggressive batter in the middle order, a limited-overs international career spanning 245 games already, with the ability to throw punches back at Australia.

The expectation is on Australia to win, and they handle it expertly, but rarely do teams attack them in the way England have.

Retreat is one thing that England will not do.

Knight marked her authority by heaving Gardner for six to get off the mark, while Sciver-Brunt's slog-sweep from her third ball was arguably reckless, but a clear sign of England's intent.

And despite the disappointment at losing the late wickets, Ecclestone calmly stated in her post-play interview that the team were smiling, and buzzing to go again on day five.

""We're going for the win,"" she said, as simple as that.

And for Wyatt, keeping it simple is the best way for her to go - if the message is to attack, her game plan is clear, and Australia will be wary.

""We have to see Danni play her shots tomorrow, she can't go into her shell,"" said former England spinner Alex Hartley on Test Match Special.

""We're in for a belter, no matter what happens.""",FAKE
"Land for Job Scam Case: PM Modi takes veiled dig at Lalu Prasad, Mamata Banerjee over job scams","PM Modi takes dig at Lalu, Mamata, says 'rate card for jobs gone'

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday attacked family-based parties. His reference to the 'rate card' for various government jobs coincided with media disclosures about alleged media disclosures about alleged bribery in thousands of recruitments in municipal bodies in West Bengal under the Mamata Banerjee government, which was already on the back foot over corruption in teachers' recruitment. His remark about a former railway minister who has been under scanner for the 'land-for-jobs' scam in the railways during his tenure was clearly a reference to RJD boss Lalu Prasad Addressing a ' National Rozgar Mela ' via video conferencing after distributing about 70,000 appointment letters to recruits in various government departments and organisations, the PM said family-based parties practised nepotism and looted the youth of the country in the name of employment whereas his government strove to safeguard the future of the youth.""Their way is the rate card, while we are working to safeguard the bright future of the youth. Rate cards shatter your ability, your potential and your dreams. We are engaged in safeguarding your every wish, aspiration, every wish and aspiration of your family. Now the country will decide if the rate card will decide the future of the youth or they will flourish safely under the safeguard ecosystem,"" PM Modi said.Referring to revelations in the media about an ED report exposing a cash-for-jobs racket in West Bengal's municipalities and municipal corporations, PM Modi said, ""You must have seen media reports a day or two ago. One state is discussed in it, the things that have come out in the investigation of the scam of cash for jobs. What is the system of that state, what has emerged, if you want a government job, then for every post, like when you go to eat food in a hotel, there is a rate card, similarly there is a 'rate card' for every post. There is also a business of 'cut money'. Where will the youth of the country go?""He further said, ""A few days ago, another case came to light. A railway minister had lands of poor farmers registered in lieu of giving them jobs. Land in return for job case is in court and under CBI probe.""The occasion also saw Modi strongly rebutting the ""Hindu chauvinism"" charge levelled by its opponents in the south. The PM said compared to a decade ago, India was a more stable, safe and strong country.",FAKE
